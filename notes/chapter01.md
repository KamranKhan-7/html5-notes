## Difference between HTML and HTML5

`HTML (older versions)` only provided basic document structure and relied on external plugins (like Flash) for `multimedia and advanced features`.

`HTML5` is the upgraded version that introduces semantic elements, native multimedia, graphics, offline storage, and APIs to support modern web applications without plugins.

### Key Features Introduced in HTML5

#### Semantic Tags →
 <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <nav> (improves readability & SEO).

#### Native Multimedia →
 <audio> and <video> for media playback without plugins.

#### Graphics Support →
 <canvas> for 2D drawing and animation, plus SVG support.

#### Form Enhancements →
 New input types (email, date, number, range, color) and attributes (placeholder, required).

#### Storage & Offline Support →
 LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and offline caching (service workers).

#### APIs →
 Geolocation, Drag-and-Drop, WebSockets, etc.

#### Responsive Support →
 Viewport control and better integration with CSS3 for mobile-friendly design.
